# Loan-Approval
Performed data Analysis on Loan Approval Dataset

Home Loan Approval Analysis - EDA
This repository explores a home loan approval dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Project Goals
. Understand the structure and characteristics of the loan approval dataset.
. Perform data cleaning and exploration.
. Identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data relevant to loan approvals.
. Create informative visualizations to communicate findings.

Data Source
. The dataset is assumed to be downloaded from Skill Circle's Google Drive (link omitted for privacy reasons).

Software
Python (libraries like pandas, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook (or similar coding environment)

Content
This repository may contain Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that guide you through the EDA process:

Data Loading and Cleaning

. Loading the dataset
. Identifying and handling missing values
.  Data cleaning procedures (if applicable)
. Data Exploration

.Analyzing data types and summary statistics
. Understanding the distribution of numeric variables (histograms, boxplots)
. Exploring the composition of categorical variables (bar charts, pie charts)

Data Visualization
. Examining relationships between numeric variables (scatter plots, pair plots)
. Investigating relationships between categorical and numeric variables (box plots, violin plots)
. Identifying correlations with a correlation heatmap
. Visualizing trends across categories with stacked bar charts

Optional: Geospatial Analysis
. Visualizing data on maps (if applicable)
. Exploring trends across geographic locations
. Getting Started

Clone this repository.
. Install required libraries (refer to the notebook for details).
. Open the Jupyter Notebook(s) and execute the code cells.
. The code cells will generate various visualizations throughout the analysis.
